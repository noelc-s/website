# Introduction
Consider the following mathematical representation of a pendulum
<img class="center" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px" src="https://noelc-s.github.io/website/img/Pendulum/pend.svg?sanitize=true">
where the mass $m$ is centered at the end of a massless rod of length $l$. Additionally denote $\theta$ as the angular deviation from vertical, $b$ as the damping coefficient, and $u$ as the input torque about the point of rotation. 
Taking $\theta\in \mathcal{Q}=\mathbb{S}$ to be the configuration space, the full state of the system is comprised of positions and velocities and will be given by $x=(\theta,\dot{\theta})\in \mathcal{X}\subset T\mathcal{Q}$.
# Dynamics
## Solutions
There does not exist a closed form solution for all initial conditions for all time of the pendulum in terms of elementary functions [1](http://www.pgccphy.net/ref/nonlin-pendulum.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3J14EOjnxSJZzAtsxGCJ7bMh9NJCMdY3RlSBmt9buxUxfeAQz1GiX-mLM). This however does not mean that we cannot characterize certain aspects of the system, which we will do in subsequent sections. By numerically integrating, we can construct a sample phase portrait (positions versus velocities) for a pendulum with damping:

In order to perform some analysis on the motion of the system, we must first produce the equations of motion.
## Euler-Lagrange
The Euler-Lagrange method is an energy-based method for constructing the equations of motion of the system. To begin, we note that the rotational kinetic energy of the system $T:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$ is given by $T(x)=\frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2$, and the potential energy of the system $V:\mathcal{Q}\to\mathbb{R}$ by $V=mgl(1-\cos\theta)$. We can therefore construct the Lagrangian as
\\[
\begin{align}
L&=T-V\notag\\\
&=\frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2-mgl(1-\cos\theta).\notag
\end{align}
\\]
We can represent the damping force as a Rayleigh dissipation function with $\mathcal{F}=\frac{1}{2}b\dot{\theta}^2$. This gives us a force in the generalized coordinates of 
\\[
Q_i = -\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial\dot{\theta}}=-b\dot{\theta}.
\\]
Employing the Lagrange d'Alembert principle results in the equations of motion of the system, as given by
\\[
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}&=Q_i+u\notag\\\
ml^2\ddot{\theta}+mgl\sin\theta&=-b\dot{\theta}+u\notag. \\\
\end{align}
\\]
Written in a more canonical form for mechanical systems, we have 
\\[
D(q) \ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q)  = Bu
\\]
where $D = ml^2$ is the mass-inertia matrix, $C=b$ contains the Coriolis and non-conservative terms, $G(\theta) = mgl\sin(\theta)$ contains the gravity terms, and $B=1$ is the actuation matrix. In order to represent the system in a convenient manner, we write the equations of motion in control-affine form:
\\[
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{\theta}\\\\ -D(q)^{-1}(C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q))\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ D(q)^{-1}B\end{bmatrix}u \notag\\\
&= \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}\dot{\theta}\\\\ -\frac{g}{l}\sin\theta-\frac{b}{ml^2}\dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix}}_{f(x)} +  \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ \frac{1}{ml^2}\end{bmatrix}}\_{g(x)}u \notag
\end{align}
\\]
In an attempt to analyze the natural dynamics of the system, we assume that the control input $u$ is equal to zero in the following discussion.
## Multiple Isolated Fixed points
Unlike linear systems, nonlinear systems can exhibit behaviors of multiple isolated fixed points, which the pendulum demonstrates well. Setting $f(x)=0$, we have that $\theta=n\pi$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $\dot{\theta}=0$, meaning the system has an infinite number of fixed points. We will later see through a geometric analysis that this can be reduced to two true states of the system with $\theta\in\\{0,\pi\\}$.
## Behavior Near Fixed Points
### Linearization
The first thing we can do to determine some characteristics of the system is to perform a linearization of the system around the fixed points. Starting with $x_0\equiv 0$, we compute the Jacobian
\\[
A(x_0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{g}{l}\cos\theta & -\frac{b}{ml^2}\end{bmatrix}(x_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{g}{l} & -\frac{b}{ml^2}\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
Now with $x_{\pi} = (\pi,0)$, we get
\\[
A(x_\pi) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_\pi)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{g}{l}\cos\theta & -\frac{b}{ml^2}\end{bmatrix}(x_\pi) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ \frac{g}{l} & -\frac{b}{ml^2}\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
#### Hartman-Grobman Theorem
The [Hartman-Grobman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem) theorem states that if the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at a fixed point has no eigenvalue purely on the imaginary axis, then there exists a homeomorphism that maps a neighborhood of the fixed point to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Additionally, the linear system is tangent to the flow of the nonlinear system "around" the fixed point. In our system, the eigenvalues of $A$ are not purely imaginary granted that $b$ is not zero.

### Local Stability
We can calculate the real parts of the eigenvalues of the linearization to determine the stability of the system about its fixed points. Let $\Delta_0=\sqrt{b^2-4m^2gl^3}$ and $\Delta_\pi=\sqrt{b^2+4m^2gl^3}$. Then, the eigenvalues are given by:
\\[
\begin{align}
\lambda(A(x_0)) &= -\frac{b\pm\Delta_0}{2ml^2} \notag\\\
\lambda(A(x_{\pi})) &= -\frac{b\pm\Delta_{\pi}}{2ml^2}.\notag
\end{align}
\\]
To determine the sign of these expressions, consider the following bounds:
\\[
\
<!-- \begin{align}
\Delta_0^2 &= b^2 - \underbrace{4m^2gl^3}_{\ge 0}\le b^2 \implies \Delta_0 \le b \notag\\\
\Delta_{\pi}^2 &= b^2 + \underbrace{4m^2gl^3}_{\ge 0}\ge b^2 \implies \Delta_{\pi} \ge b, \notag
\end{align} -->
\\]
which hold because of the fact that the parameters $m,g,l$ are all positive. With this, we have that the real part of $\lambda(A(x_0))$ are both negative, and the real part of the second $\lambda(A(x_\pi))$ is positive. Therefore, the linearization about $A_0$ is stable, but for $A_\pi$, the system is unstable. This matches intuition; an upright pendulum falls over, whereas a freely swinging pendulum will eventually come to rest and the origin. By the Hartman-Grobman theorem, we know that the nonlinear system exhibits similar behavior around the fixed points. Show mapping. This is where global and local picture should go.

## Lyapunov
What if, however, the linearization of the system was hyperbolic, as would be the case if $b$ were equal to zero. Lyapunov methods are more generalizable than linearization methods, and will be useful for constructing controllers in the subsequent sections. We will construct a candidate Lyapunov function from the Hamiltonian (total energy) of the system:
\\[
V(q) = H(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = T+V = \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2+mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).
\\]
In order to determine the stability of the system, we differentiate $V(q(t))$ as in
\\[
\begin{align}
\dot{V}(q(t)) &= \frac{dV}{dq}f(q) = mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta} + ml^2\dot{\theta}\ddot{\theta} \notag\\\
&= mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta}-ml^2\dot{\theta}(\frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta)+\frac{b}{ml^2}\dot{\theta}) \notag \\\
&= -b\dot{\theta}^2 <0.\notag
\end{align}
\\]
Based on Lyapunov theory, because $V$ is a positive definite function, if $b=0$, then $\dot{V}\le 0$ implies stability of the system, which we know to be true. As before, if $b > 0$, $\dot{V}$ is negaitve definite, the system can be is determined to be locally asympotically stable about the origin $x_0$.

### La Salle's Theorem 
## Differential Geometry
The configuration manifold of the system is $\mathbb{S}^1$. Because $\mathbb{S}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\backslash\~$ where $~$ represents the equivalence class given by $\mathcal{R}={2\pi n}, n\in\mathbb{Z}$, the phase portrait should repeat iself every $2\pi$. Because $\mathbb{S}^1$ is a Lie group, the configuration manifold of this system is parallelizable, meaning $TQ\cong\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{R}$. An interesting aside is that if we considered the $n$ pendulum (i.e. the connected pendulum with $n$ degrees of freedom), if $n$ were even, the configuration manifold would not be parallelizable by the [Hairy Ball Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem). In dynamical systems, the phase space of the system lies on tangent bundle, $TQ$.
